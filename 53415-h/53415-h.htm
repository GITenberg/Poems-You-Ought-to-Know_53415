<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Each morning, for several months, <span class="smcap">The
Chicago Tribune</span> has published at the head of its first
column, verses under the caption: &ldquo;Poems You Ought to
Know.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has explained its action by the following
quotation from Professor Charles Eliot Norton:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Whatever your occupation may be</i>,
<i>and however crowded your hours with affairs</i>, <i>do not
fail to secure at least a few minutes every day for refreshment
of your inner life with a bit of poetry</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By publishing these poems <span class="smcap">The
Tribune</span> hopes to accomplish two things: first, to inspire
a love of poetry in the hearts of many of its readers who have
never before taken time or thought to read the best poems of this
and other centuries and lands; and, secondly, to remind those who
once loved song, but forgot it among the louder voices of the
world, of the melody that enchanted them in youth.</p>
<p>The title has carried with it its own standard, and the poems
have been kept on a plane above jocularity or mere prettiness of
versification; rather have they tried to teach the doctrines of
courage, of nature-love, of pure and noble melody.&nbsp; It has
been the ambition of those selecting the verses to choose
something to lift the reader above the &ldquo;petty round of
irritating concerns and duties,&rdquo; and the object will have
been achieved if it has helped anyone to &ldquo;play the
man,&rdquo; &ldquo;to go blithely about his business all the
day,&rdquo; with a consciousness of that abounding beauty in the
world of thought which is the common property of all men.</p>
<p>No anthology of English verse can be complete, and none can
satisfy all.&nbsp; The compiler&rsquo;s individual taste,
tempered and guided by established authority, is almost the only
standard.&nbsp; This collection has been compiled not by one but
by many thousands, and their selections here appear edited and
winnowed as the idea of the series seemed to dictate.&nbsp; The
book appears at the wide-spread and almost universal request of
those who have watched the bold experiment of a great
Twentieth-Century American newspaper giving the place of honor in
its columns every day to a selection from the poets.</p>
<p>For permission to reprint certain poems by Longfellow, Lowell,
Harte, Hay, Bayard Taylor, Holmes, Whittier, Parsons, and
Aldrich, graciously accorded by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., the
publishers, thanks are gratefully acknowledged.&nbsp; To Charles
Scribner&rsquo;s Sons, for an extract from Lanier&rsquo;s poems,
and, lastly, to the many thousand readers, who, by their
sympathy, appreciation, and help have encouraged the continuance
of the daily publication of the poems, similar gratitude is
felt.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">BY WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.</span></h2>
<p>William Wordsworth was born in 1770 and died at Rydal Mount in
1850.&nbsp; He was educated in Cambridge, where he graduated in
1791.&nbsp; He traveled on the continent before that, but he
settled down for several years in Dorset.&nbsp; A visit from
Coleridge determined his career in 1796.&nbsp; He was again
abroad in 1798, but returned the following year and went to live
at Grasmere in the Lake District.&nbsp; He held severai
government positions and was poet laureate from 1843 to his
death.&nbsp; His chief works are, &ldquo;The Evening Walk,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Descriptive Sketches,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Excursion,&rdquo;
&ldquo;White Doe of Rylston,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanksgiving
Ode,&rdquo; &ldquo;Peter Bell,&rdquo; &ldquo;Waggoner,&rdquo;
&ldquo;River Duddon,&rdquo; A Series of Sonnets, &ldquo;The
Borderers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yarrow Revisited,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Prelude.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">A flock of sheep that leisurely pass by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One after one; the sound of rain, and bees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Murmuring; the fall of rivers, winds and seas,<br />
Smooth fields, white sheets of water, and pure sky;</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;ve thought of all by turns, and still I
lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleepless; and soon the small birds&rsquo;
melodies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must hear, first utter&rsquo;d from my orchard
trees,<br />
And the first cuckoo&rsquo;s melancholy cry.</p>
<p class="poetry">Even thus last night and two nights more I
lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And could not win thee, Sleep, by any stealth;<br />
So do not let me wear tonight away;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without thee what is all the morning&rsquo;s
wealth?<br />
Come, blessed barrier between day and day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health!</p>

<p>Charles Lamb was born at London in 1775.&nbsp; His most
successful writings are the &ldquo;Tales from Shakespeare&rdquo;
(written in collaboration with his sister), and his &ldquo;Essays

<p class="poetry">I have had playmates, I have had companions,<br

All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</p>

All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</p>

Closed are her doors on me, I must not see her&mdash;<br />
All, all are gone the old familiar faces.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have a friend, a kinder friend has no man;<br

Like an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly;<br />
Left him to muse on the old familiar faces.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ghost-like I pace round the haunts of my

Earth seemed a desert I was bound to traverse,<br />
Seeking to find the old familiar faces.</p>
<p class="poetry">Friend of my bosom, thou more than a

Why wert not thou born in my father&rsquo;s dwelling?<br />
So might we talk of the old familiar faces&mdash;</p>

left me,<br />
And some are taken from me; all are departed&mdash;<br />
All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</p>

22</span>FATE.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY SUSAN MARR SPALDING.</span></h2>
<p>Susan Marr Spalding was born in Bath, Me., and educated in a
seminary there.&nbsp; From early girlhood she wrote verse, her
sonnets being graceful and tender.&nbsp; At the death of her
parents she lived with her uncle, a clergyman, in New York.&nbsp;
She married Mr. Spalding, a literary man, and made her home in
Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="poetry">Two shall be born, the whole wide world
apart,<br />
And speak in different tongues, and have no thought<br />
Each of the other&rsquo;s being; and have no heed;<br />
And these, o&rsquo;er unknown seas to unknown lands<br />
Shall cross, escaping wreck; defying death;<br />
And, all unconsciously, shape every act to this one end<br />
That, one day, out of darkness, they shall meet<br />
And read life&rsquo;s meaning in each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">And two shall walk some narrow way of life<br
/>
So nearly side by side that, should one turn<br />
Ever so little space to right or left,<br />
They needs must stand acknowledged face to face.<br />
And yet, with wistful eyes that never meet.<br />
With groping hands that never clasp; and lips<br />
Calling in vain to ears that never hear;<br />
They seek each other all their weary days<br />
And die unsatisfied&mdash;and that is fate.</p>

NATION.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY RICHARD REALF.</span></h2>
<p>Richard Realf was born in England in 1834 of poor parents and
began writing poetry at an early age.&nbsp; His early work
attracted the attention of Tennyson, Miss Mitford, Miss Jameson,
Miss Martineau, and others, and they secured the publication of
his volume, &ldquo;Guesses at the Beautiful.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
dabbled some in sculpture, and even studied agricultural
science.&nbsp; In 1854 he came to New York, where he wrote
stories of slum life and assisted in establishing some
institutions for the relief of the poor.&nbsp; He joined the
first free soil parties moving to Kansas and was arrested.&nbsp;
He did newspaper work until he joined John Brown&rsquo;s
party.&nbsp; He was Brown&rsquo;s secretary of state.&nbsp; He
was arrested in connection with the Harper&rsquo;s Ferry affair,
enlisted in 1862, was wounded, taught a black school in South
Carolina in 1867, and for years led a hand to mouth existence,
all that time writing poetry, some of it of the most exquisite
beauty.&nbsp; Family troubles resulted in his suicide in San
Francisco about 1875.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let Liberty run onward with the years,<br />
And circle with the seasons; let her break<br />
The tyrant&rsquo;s harshness, the oppressor&rsquo;s spears;<br />
Bring ripened recompenses that shall make<br />
Supreme amends for sorrow&rsquo;s long arrears;<br />
Drop holy benison on hearts that ache;<br />
Put clearer radiance into human eyes,<br />
And set the glad earth singing to the skies.</p>
<p class="poetry">Clean natures coin pure statutes.&nbsp; Let us
cleanse<br />
The hearts that beat within us; let us mow<br />
Clear to the roots our falseness and pretense,<br />
Tread down our rank ambitions, overthrow<br />
Our braggart moods of puffed self-consequence,<br />
Plow up our hideous thistles which do grow<br />
Faster than maize in May time, and strike dead<br />
The base infections our low greeds have bred.</p>

<p>Alfred Tennyson was born at Lincolnshire in 1809.&nbsp; In
1828 he wrote, with his brother, the &ldquo;Poems by Two
Brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went to Trinity College, Cambridge,
where he met his friend, Arthur Hallam, upon whose death he wrote
&ldquo;In Memoriam.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Wordsworth died in 1850,
the laureateship was given to Tennyson; later he was made a
Baron.&nbsp; He died at Aldworth, on the Isle of Wight, in 1892,
and has been given a place in Westminster Abbey near the grave of
Chaucer.&nbsp; Other of his longer poems beside the one mentioned
above are: &ldquo;The Princess,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maud,&rdquo;

<span class="GutSmall">BY J. L. McCREERY.</span></h2>
<p>This beautifully touching poem is the creation of Mr. J. L.
McCreery, a native of Iowa, and at one time editor of the
Delaware County Journal, of that state.&nbsp; The poem was
written in 1863 and was first published in Arthur&rsquo;s Home
Magazine in July of that year.&nbsp; The authorship of the poem
was for many years erroneously attributed to Lord Lytton, the
English poet.&nbsp; A thorough investigation carried on by
Lippincott&rsquo;s a few years ago fully established the
authorship.&nbsp; The poem has been printed in every state of the
Union, in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Canada, and even in
Australia.&nbsp; It has gone into dozens of school books and been
incorporated in scores of miscellaneous collections of
poetry.&nbsp; It has been quoted in full or in part at least five
times on the floor of Congress.&nbsp; Mr. McCreery has for the
past few years been a resident of the national capital and his
best poems have been collected into a volume entitled
&ldquo;Songs of Toil and Triumph.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">There is no death, the stars go down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To rise upon some other shore,<br />
And bright in heaven&rsquo;s jeweled crown<br />

<p class="poetry">The royal feast was done; the king<br />

<p class="poetry">Backward, turn backward, O Time in your

Make me a child again just for tonight;<br />
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,<br />
Take me again to your heart as of yore;<br />
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,<br />
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;<br />
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;<br />

Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away;<br />
Weary of sowing for others to reap;<br />
Rock me to sleep, mother&mdash;rock me to sleep.</p>

No love like mother love ever has shone;<br />
No other worship abides and endures&mdash;<br />
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours;<br />
None like a mother can charm away pain<br />
From the sick soul and world weary brain.<br />

Fall on your shoulders again as of old;<br />
Let it drop over my forehead tonight,<br />

Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;<br />
Lovingly, softly its bright billows sweep;<br />
Rock me to sleep, mother&mdash;rock me to sleep.</p>

With your light lashes just sweeping my face,<br />
Never hereafter to wake or to weep&mdash;<br />

<p>Lord Byron was born in London in 1788.&nbsp; His first volume
of verses, entitled &ldquo;Hours of Idleness,&rdquo; was printed
in 1807.&nbsp; &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lament of
Tasso&rdquo; were written in 1817.&nbsp; From 1818 to his death
Byron was occupied on &ldquo;Don Juan.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1823 he
went to Greece, and with advice and money aided in the Greek
struggle for independence.&nbsp; He died in Greece in 1824.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>And it came to pass</i>, <i>that
night</i>, <i>that the angel of the Lord went out and smote in
the camp of the Assyrians an hundred four score and five

<p class="poetry">The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the

And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;<br />
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,<br />
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.</p>

<p class="poetry">For the angel of death spread his wings on the
blast,<br />
And breathed in the face of the foe as he pass&rsquo;d;<br />
And the eyes of the sleepers wax&rsquo;d deadly and chill,<br />
And their hearts but once heaved&mdash;and forever grew
still.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there lay the steed with his nostril all
wide,<br />
But through it there roll&rsquo;d not the breath of his pride;<br

And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,<br />
And cold as the spray of the rock beating surf.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there lay the rider, distorted and pale,<br

With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail;<br />
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,<br />
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.</p>

<h2>THE DEATH BED.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY THOMAS HOOD.</span></h2>
<p>Thomas Hood was born in London in 1799, and early in life
turned his attention to literary pursuits.&nbsp; At the age of 22
he became sub-editor of the London Magazine, which gave him
acquaintance with all the literary men of the age, and an
intimacy with Charles Lamb, which continued until his
death.&nbsp; He was a voluminous writer, both in poetry and
prose, contributing to various magazines.&nbsp; In 1844
Hood&rsquo;s Magazine was started, for which he furnished most of
the material until near his death.&nbsp; His best work was done
during his last sickness, when, on a bed of suffering, he
contributed to Punch those touching verses which have rendered
his name immortal: &ldquo;The Song of the Shirt&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Bridge of Sighs.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died May 3, 1845.</p>
<p class="poetry">We watched her sleeping through the night,<br
/>
Her breathing soft and low,<br />
As in her breast the wave of life<br />
Kept surging to and fro.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So silently we seemed to speak,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So slowly moved about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we had lent her half our
powers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To eke her being out.<br />
Our very hopes belied our fears,<br />
Our fears our hopes belied,<br />
We thought her dying when she slept,<br />
And sleeping when she died.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For when the morn came dim and
sad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And chill with early showers,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her quiet eyelids closed, she
had<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another morn than ours.</p>

46</span>RUTHLESS TIME.<br />

<span class="GutSmall">(From &ldquo;Troilus and
Cressida.&rdquo;)</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,<br />
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,<br />
A great sized monster of ingratitudes;<br />
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour&rsquo;d<br />
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon<br />
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,<br />
Keeps honor bright; to have done is to hang<br />
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail<br />
In monumental mockery.&nbsp; Take th&rsquo; instant way;<br />
For honor travels in a straight so narrow,<br />
Where one but goes abreast; keep, then, the path;<br />
For emulation hath a thousand sons,<br />
That one by one pursue: if you give way,<br />
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,<br />
Like to an enter&rsquo;d tide, they all rush by<br />
And leave you hindmost;<br />
Or like a gallant horse fallen in first rank,<br />
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,<br />
O&rsquo;errun and trampled on.</p>

Though shunned by the women of her acquaintance, Eliot was
courted by the greatest philosophers of her time.</p>
<p class="poetry">Two lovers by a moss-grown spring:<br />

EMPEROR&rsquo;S DAUGHTER STANDS ALONE.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY GEOFFREY CHAUCER.</span></h2>
<p>Geoffrey Chaucer, often called the father of English verse,
was born some time after 1340, served with Edward III. in the
French campaigns and was imprisoned in France.&nbsp; He was on an
embassy to Genoa in 1372, met Petrarch, and got from him the tale
of Griselda and other Italian legends.&nbsp; On his return he
occupied various positions of trust, principally of a diplomatic
nature.&nbsp; His last days were spent in obscurity.&nbsp; He
died in London in 1400, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Canterbury Tales,&rdquo; founded for the
most part upon the same stories that Boccaccio and other writers
had made famous in prose, are almost the first evidence of the
influence of the Italian Renaissance upon English
literature.&nbsp; He wrote many detached pieces as well, although
his reputation rests largely upon the &ldquo;Tales.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He had not only the true poetic instinct, but a deep knowledge
and intense love of nature, and he gave a great inspiration to
the writers of the golden age which followed his own.&nbsp; As
Tennyson says of him in &ldquo;A Dream of Fair Women:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Dan Chaucer</i>, <i>the first warbler
whose sweet breath</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Preluded those melodious bursts that fill</i><br
/>
<i>The spacious times of great Elizabeth</i><br />

62</span>DELIGHT IN DISORDER.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY ROBERT HERRICK.</span></h2>
<p>It is in such poems as the following one that Herrick is at
his best; his religious, or, as he called them, his &ldquo;noble
numbers,&rdquo; being for the most part inferior.&nbsp; But in
his lyrics, as Austin Dobson says, his &ldquo;numbers are of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">A sweet disorder in the dress<br />
Kindles in clothes a wantonness;<br />
A lawn about the shoulders thrown,<br />
Into a fine distraction;<br />
An erring lace, which here and there<br />
Enthralls the crimson stomacher;<br />
A cuff neglected, and thereby<br />
Ribbands to flow confusedly;<br />
A winning wave, deserving note,<br />
In the tempestuous petticoat;<br />
A careless shoestring, in whose tie<br />
I see a wild civility;<br />
Doth more bewitch me than when art<br />
Is too precise in every part.</p>

<p>Edward J. McPhelim, a singer of many sweet songs, became mute
in 1896 at an age all too young.&nbsp; For several years he was
dramatic and literary critic for &ldquo;The Tribune,&rdquo;
departments in which his rare critical ability and wonderful
command of language found full scope.&nbsp; His poems, which have
never been collected, contain fancies as poetic and delicate as
any in the English tongue.&nbsp; The following, on Lamb and his
sister, is significant, considering where McPhelim&rsquo;s last
days were spent:</p>
<p class="poetry">Across the English meadows sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the smiling sunset land,<br />
I see them walk with faltering feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother and sister, hand in hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">They know the hour of parting nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They pass into the dying day,<br />
And, lo! against the sunset sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looms up the madhouse gaunt and gray.</p>

Of unforgotten long ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before his heart had known despair.</p>
<p class="poetry">He waits till she may come once more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From out the darkness to his side,<br />
To share the changeless love of yore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all the old, old loves have died.</p>

The sad scene rises, and I look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a jester&mdash;or a saint.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; With love and laughter&mdash;and there falls<br />
Across the page forever more,<br />

<p>This ballad by a poet of our own time finds its way into the
hearts of those who have read and loved the song-story of
Aucassin and Nicolete.&nbsp; It has about it the fragrance and
na&iuml;vet&eacute; of that &ldquo;good lay,&rdquo; it contains
the &ldquo;force and freshness of young passion, the
troubadour&rsquo;s sweetness of literary manner,&rdquo; as Mr. Le
Gallienne says of another poem on the same subject written by
Edmund Clarence Stedman.</p>
<p class="poetry">All bathed in pearl and amber light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She rose to fling the lattice wide,<br />
And leaned into the fragrant night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where brown birds sang of summertide;<br />
(&rsquo;Twas Love&rsquo;s own voice that called and cried).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah Sweet!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
seek thee yet,<br />
Though thorniest pathways should betide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fair white feet of Nicolete.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">They slept, who would have staid her flight;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Full fain were they the maid had died);<br />
She dropped adown her prison&rsquo;s height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On strands of linen featly tied.<br />
And so she passed the garden side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With loose leaved roses sweetly set,<br />
And dainty daisies, dark beside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fair white feet of Nicolete!</p>
<p class="poetry">Her lover lay in evil plight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (So many lovers yet abide!)<br />
I would my tongue could praise aright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her name, that should be glorified.<br />

79</span>NIGHT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY JOSEPH BLANCO WHITE.</span></h2>
<p>Joseph Blanco White was born of Irish parents in Seville,
Spain, July 11, 1775, and was put in training for a mercantile
career, but he left his father&rsquo;s counting house and was
ordained a priest in 1796, and continued in the priesthood until
1810, when, because of the political crisis in Spain, he went to
England, residing in London as a man of letters, where he
contributed largely to the leading reviews and periodicals, and
produced several books, treating mostly of Spain and its
affairs.&nbsp; He died in May, 1841.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Sonnet to
Night&rdquo; was pronounced by Coleridge the finest in the
English language.</p>
<p class="poetry">Mysterious Night when our first parent knew<br
/>
Thee from report divine, and heard thy name,<br />
Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,<br />
This glorious canopy of light and blue;<br />
Yet &rsquo;neath a curtain of translucent hue,<br />
Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,<br />
Hesperus with the host of heaven came,<br />
And, lo! creation widened in man&rsquo;s view.<br />
Who would have thought such darkness lay concealed<br />
Within thy beams, O Sun! or who could find,<br />
Whilst flower and leaf and insect stood revealed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That to such countless orbs thou mad&rsquo;st us
blind?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do we then shun death with anxious
strife&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If light can thus deceive us, wherefore not
life?</p>

<span class="GutSmall">BY SAMUEL WOODWORTH.</span></h2>
<p>Samuel Woodworth was born at Scituate, Mass., in 1785, and was
the son of a farmer and revolutionary soldier.&nbsp; He had no
educational advantages until taken up by a clergyman, who had
read some of his poetical writings and who gave him instruction
in the classics.&nbsp; Woodworth was apprenticed to a printer,
and later published a paper of his own, of which he was editor,
printer, and carrier.&nbsp; Later he removed to New York, where
he edited magazines and wrote a number of volumes.&nbsp; His
patriotic songs of the war of 1812 were widely popular.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Old Oaken Bucket&rdquo; will always hold its place among
the choicest songs of America.&nbsp; Woodworth died in New York
in 1842.</p>
<p class="poetry">How dear to this heart are the scenes of my
childhood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When fond recollection presents them to view!<br />
The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wildwood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every loved spot which my infancy knew;<br />
The wide-spreading pond, and the mill which stood by it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell;<br

The cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it,<br />

The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,<br />
The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.</p>
<p class="poetry">That moss-covered vessel I hail as a
treasure;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For often, at noon, when returned from the field,<br

I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.<br />
How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell;<br />

Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though filled with the nectar that Jupiter sips.<br

And, now far removed from the loved situation,<br />

A GRECIAN URN.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY JOHN KEATS.</span></h2>
<p>John Keats was born at London in 1795.&nbsp; He studied
medicine, but after passing his examinations he never
practiced.&nbsp; About this time he became acquainted with
Shelley, Leigh Hunt, and Haydon.&nbsp; In 1820 he went to Naples
on account of his health, and from there to Rome, where he died
in 1821.&nbsp; His longer poems are; &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo;
(which poem was most severely criticised at the time of its
publication), &ldquo;Lamia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Isabella,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Eve of Saint Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou still unravished bride of quietness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou foster child of Silence and slow Time,<br />
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme;<br />
What leaf-fring&rsquo;d legend haunts about thy shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of deities or mortals, or of both,<br />
In Tempe or the dales of Arcady:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What men or gods are these?&nbsp; What maidens
loath?<br />
What mad pursuit?&nbsp; What struggles to escape?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What pipes and timbrels?&nbsp; What wild
ecstasy?</p>
<p class="poetry">Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;<br

Not to the sensual ear, but, more endeared,<br />

She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!</p>
<p class="poetry">O, Attic shape!&nbsp; Fair attitude! with
brede<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of marble men and maidens overwrought,<br />
With forest branches and the trodden weed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought<br

As doth eternity: Cold pastoral!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When old age shall this generation waste,<br />
Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe<br />

<p>This lyric of Richard Lovelace&rsquo;s is, with the
&ldquo;Lucasta,&rdquo; the best known and most often quoted of
his poems.</p>
<p class="poetry">When Love with unconfined wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hovers within my gates,<br />
And my divine Althea brings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whisper at my grates;<br />
When I lie tangled in her hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fettered with her eye,<br />
The birds that wanton in the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know no such liberty.</p>
<p class="poetry">When flowing cups pass swiftly round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With no allaying Thames,<br />
Our careless heads with roses crowned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hearts with loyal flames;<br />
When thirsty grief in wine we steep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When healths and draughts go free&mdash;<br />
Fishes that tipple in the deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know no such liberty.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Thy mercy, sweetness, majesty<br />

When I shall voice aloud how good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He is, how great should be,<br />
The enlarged winds that curl the flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know no such liberty.</p>
<p class="poetry">Stone walls do not a prison make,<br />

Minds innocent and quiet take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That for a hermitage;<br />
If I have freedom in my love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in my soul am free,<br />
Angels alone, that soar above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy such liberty.</p>

100</span>SONG.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY JOHN BUNYAN.</span></h2>
<p>John Bunyan was born at Elstow in 1628.&nbsp; He was a tinker,
as his father was before him, but he finally became a soldier in
the parliamentary army.&nbsp; In 1653 he became a nonconformist
and went about the country preaching until he was arrested under
the statutes against that doctrine.&nbsp; While in prison Bunyan
began his well-known allegory&mdash;&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under Charles II. he was released and made
pastor at Bedford.&nbsp; He died at London in 1688.</p>
<p class="poetry">He that is down need fear no fall;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He that is low, no pride;<br />
He that is humble ever shall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have God to be his guide.</p>
<p class="poetry">I am content with what I have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Little be it or much;<br />
And, Lord, contentment still I crave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because thou savest such.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fullness to such a burden is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That go on pilgrimage;<br />
Here little, and hereafter bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is best from age to age.</p>

<p>In the early part of the last century, when the star of Moore
was at its zenith, no song was more popular than this, perhaps as
much for the charming air to which it is set as for the beauty

<p class="poetry">Believe me, if all those endearing charms,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Let thy loveliness fade as it will<br />
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would entwine itself verdantly still.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is not while beauty and youth are thine
own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy cheeks unprofan&rsquo;d by a tear,<br />
That the fervor and faith of a soul can be known,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which time will but make thee more dear;<br />
No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But as surely loves on to the close,<br />
As the sunflower turns on her god, when he sets,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The same look that she turned when he rose.</p>

<p class="poetry">The world is too much with us; late and

Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;<br />
Little we see in nature that is ours;<br />
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!<br />
This sea that bares her bosom to the moon;<br />
The winds that will be howling at all hours,<br />
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;<br />
For this, for everything, we are out of tune;<br />
It moves us not&mdash;Great God!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be<br />
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn,<br />
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,<br />

Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,<br />
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn!</p>

<p>Pope was born at London in 1688.&nbsp; He had no school
education, as he was always sickly, but he learned Latin and
Greek from several friends.&nbsp; By the time he was 17 he was an
acknowledged wit and critic.&nbsp; His first published poem was
&ldquo;The Pastorals,&rdquo; 1709; then followed &ldquo;The Rape
of the Lock,&rdquo; his best satirical poem, and the next year
(1713) he began his translation of the &ldquo;Iliad.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He died at Twickenham in 1744.</p>

104</span>PATRIOTISM.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY SIR WALTER SCOTT.</span></h2>
<p>Sir Walter Scott was born at Edinburgh in 1771.&nbsp; He first
began his writing by translating Burger and Goethe, but he left
this work to take up the Border Minstrelsy of his own
country.&nbsp; In 1814 he published the first of the well-known
&ldquo;Waverley&rdquo; novels.&nbsp; He sold his copyrights to
the firm of Constable, and as the house failed a few years later
Scott was heavily involved.&nbsp; As he had also recently bought
and repaired the estate of Abbotsford, he was in debt for that
also.&nbsp; In spite of ill health he wrote incessantly in order
to meet his bills, and gave to the world the novels and poems
with which all are so familiar.&nbsp; He died in 1832.</p>
<p class="poetry">Breathes there a man with soul so dead<br />
Who never to himself hath said,<br />
&ldquo;This is my own, my native land!&rdquo;<br />
Whose heart hath ne&rsquo;er within him burned<br />
As home his footsteps he hath turned<br />
From wandering on a foreign strand?<br />
If such there breathe, go, mark him well!<br />
For him no minstrel raptures swell;<br />
High though his titles, proud his name,<br />
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim&mdash;<br />
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,<br />
The wretch, concentered all in self,<br />
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,<br />
And, doubly dying, shall go down<br />
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,<br />
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.</p>

family of seventeen children.&nbsp; Her maiden name was
Hart.&nbsp; She was born at Berlin, Conn., in 1787.&nbsp; She
began teaching in the village school and later became principal
of a girls&rsquo; college at Westfield, Conn., and after her
marriage to Dr. John Willard in 1814, opened a boarding school at
Middlebury, Conn, into which she introduced new methods and new
studies.&nbsp; The school was removed to Troy, N. Y., and became
the Troy Female Academy.&nbsp; Retiring from the school in 1858,
Mrs. Willard spent the remaining years of her life in revising
her text books and writing a volume of poems.&nbsp; She died in
1876.</p>

<p>The influence of poetry is greater than is generally realized,
and many find inspiration to action in reading it.&nbsp; Mrs.
Browning in this pathetic poem did much to rouse England to the
evil of child labor and to perceive the wrongs done the little
ones toiling in its factories and coal mines far beyond their
strength.</p>
<p class="poetry">Do ye hear the children weeping, O, my

Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,<br />
And to the presence in the room he said,<br />
&ldquo;What writest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; The vision raised its
head,<br />
And with a look made all of sweet accord,<br />
Answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;The names of those who love the
Lord.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And is mine one?&rdquo; said Abou.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, not

Replied the angel.&nbsp; Abou spoke more low,<br />
But cheerily still, and said, &ldquo;I pray thee, then,<br />
Write me as one who loves his fellowmen.&rdquo;<br />
The angel wrote and vanish&rsquo;d.&nbsp; The next night<br />

<p>This imperishable poem was written by William Cullen Bryant
when he was 18 years old.&nbsp; It was sent to the North American
Review either by the poet or his father.&nbsp; Richard Henry Dana
of the Review supposed the writer to be some one of international
repute.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s father was then a member of the
Massachusetts senate.&nbsp; Dana went to the statehouse to call
on him, but the appearance of Dr. Bryant seemed to satisfy Dana
that he must look elsewhere for the author, and so he returned to
Cambridge without an interview with the senator.&nbsp; Later he
learned that the author was the doctor&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p class="poetry">To him who, in the love of nature, holds<br />
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks<br />
A various language; for his gayer hours<br />
She has a voice of gladness and a smile<br />
And eloquence of beauty; and she glides<br />
Into his darker musings with a mild<br />
And healing sympathy, that steals away<br />
Their sharpness, ere he is aware.&nbsp; When thoughts<br />
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight<br />
Over thy spirit, and sad images<br />
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,<br />
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,<br />
Make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart,<br />
Go forth under the open sky, and list<br />
To Nature&rsquo;s teachings, while from all around&mdash;<br />
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air&mdash;<br />
Comes a still voice:&nbsp; Yet a few days, and thee<br />

Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist<br />
Thy image.&nbsp; Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim<br />
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;<br />
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up<br />
Thine individual being, shalt thou go<br />
To mix forever with the elements;<br />
To be a brother to the insensible rock,<br />
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain<br />
Turns with his share, and treads upon.&nbsp; The oak<br />
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.<br />
Yet not to thine eternal resting place<br />
Shalt thou retire alone&mdash;nor couldst thou wish<br />
Couch more magnificent.&nbsp; Thou shalt lie down<br />
With patriarchs of the infant world&mdash;with kings,<br />
The powerful of the earth&mdash;the wise, the good,<br />
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,<br />
All in one mighty sepulcher.&nbsp; The hills,<br />
Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun; the vales<br />
Stretching in pensive quietness between;<br />
The venerable woods; rivers that move<br />

That slumber in its bosom.&nbsp; Take the wings<br />
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,<br />

Where rolls the Oregon and hears no sound<br />
Save his own dashings&mdash;yet the dead are there!<br />
And millions in those solitudes, since first<br />
The flight of years began, have laid them down<br />
In their last sleep&mdash;the dead reign there alone!<br />

When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care<br />
Plod on, and each one, as before, will chase<br />
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave<br />
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come<br />
And make their bed with thee.&nbsp; As the long train<br />
Of ages glides away, the sons of men&mdash;<br />
The youth in life&rsquo;s green spring, and he who goes<br />
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,<br />
And the sweet babe, and the gray headed man&mdash;<br />
Shall, one by one, be gathered to thy side<br />
By those who in their turn shall follow them.</p>
<p class="poetry">So live, that when thy summons comes to join<br
/>
The innumerable caravan that moves<br />
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take<br />
His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br />
Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,<br />
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed<br />
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave<br />
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch<br />
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>Francis Scott Key was born in Frederick County, Maryland, in
1780.&nbsp; He was the author of a volume of poems published in
1857, but the poem that will keep him alive in the memory of the
nation is his &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner.&rdquo;&nbsp; This poem
was written on shipboard during the war of 1812, while the
English were bombarding Fort McHenry.&nbsp; Mr. Key died at
Baltimore in 1843.</p>
<p class="poetry">O! say, can you see, by the dawn&rsquo;s early
light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&rsquo;s
last gleaming?<br />
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro&rsquo; the perilous
fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly
streaming!<br />
And the rocket&rsquo;s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br

Gave proof thro&rsquo; the night that our flag was still
there;<br />
O! say, does that star spangled banner yet wave<br />
O&rsquo;er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</p>
<p class="poetry">On that shore, dimly seen thro&rsquo; the mists
of the deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the foe&rsquo;s haughty host in dread silence
reposes,<br />
What is that which the breeze, o&rsquo;er the towering steep,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now
discloses?<br />
Now it catches the gleam of the morning&rsquo;s first beam,<br />
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream;<br />
&rsquo;Tis the star spangled banner, O, long may it wave<br />

<p class="poetry">And where is that band who so vauntingly
swore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the havoc of war and the battle&rsquo;s
confusion,<br />

footsteps&rsquo; pollution;<br />
No refuge could save the hireling and slave<br />

<span class="GutSmall">BY JOHN LOWE.</span></h2>
<p>John Lowe, the author of this poem, was born at Kenmure,
parish of Kells, Kircudbrightshire, Scotland, in 1750.&nbsp; His
father was a gardener, and at the age of 14 John was apprenticed
to a weaver, but in 1771 he was enabled to go to the University
of Edinburgh.&nbsp; Later he entered the family of Mr. McGhie of
Airds, whose house was located on an elevated piece of ground
washed by the Dee and Ken, a spot reverenced by Lowe for its
beauty.&nbsp; Within the grounds he erected a rural seat
environed with honeysuckle, woodbine, and other shrubs, which is
known to this day as &ldquo;Lowe&rsquo;s Seat,&rdquo; and there
he composed many of his most beautiful verses.</p>
<p class="poetry">The moon had climbed the highest hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That rises o&rsquo;er the source of Dee,<br />
And from the eastern summit shed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her silver light on tower and tree;<br />
When Mary laid her down to sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts on Sandy far at sea;<br />
When, soft and low, a voice was heard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, &ldquo;Mary, weep no more for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She from her pillow gently raised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her head to ask who there might be,<br />
And saw young Sandy shivering stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With visage pale and hollow e&rsquo;e.<br />
&ldquo;O, Mary dear, cold is my clay,<br />

Far, far from thee I sleep in death,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart was filled with love for thee.<br />
The storm is past and I at rest,<br />

Where love is free from doubt and care,<br />

By thoughts and wishes manifold; whose breath<br />
Is freshness, and whose mighty pulse is peace.</p>

reduced to extreme destitution, committed suicide.&nbsp; His
Rowley poems, which he said were translations from the writings

discussion.&nbsp; Besides those he wrote &ldquo;The Tragedy of
Aella,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Battle of Hastings,&rdquo; &ldquo;The

sung on the memorable occasion when the three disguised youths

<p class="poetry">Tears, idle tears, I know not what they
mean,<br />
Tears from the depth of some divine despair<br />
Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,<br />
In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,<br />
And thinking of the days that are no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fresh as the first beam glittering on a
sail,<br />
That brings our friends up from the underworld,<br />
Sad as the last which reddens over one<br />
That sinks with all we love below the verge;<br />
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns<br
/>
The earliest pipe of half-awaken&rsquo;d birds<br />
To dying ears when unto dying eyes<br />
The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;<br />
So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dear as remembered kisses after death,<br />
And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign&rsquo;d<br />
On lips that are for others; deep as love,<br />
Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;<br />
O, death in life, the days that are no more.</p>

ARSENAL AT SPRINGFIELD.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Longfellow and his second wife, during their honeymoon,
visited the United States arsenal at Springfield, Mass., about
half a century ago.&nbsp; The figure of speech in which the poet
speaks of the burnished arms rising like a huge organ was
suggested by Mrs. Longfellow.&nbsp; The poem was inspired by
Charles Sumner&rsquo;s oration, &ldquo;The True Grandeur of
Nations,&rdquo; which was an argument for peace and against
war.</p>
<p class="poetry">This is the Arsenal.&nbsp; From floor to
ceiling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms;<br />
But from their silent pipes no anthem pealing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Startles the villages with strange alarms.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, what a sound will rise, how wild and
dreary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the death angel touches those swift keys!<br />
What loud lament and dismal Miserere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will mingle with their awful symphonies!</p>
<p class="poetry">I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cries of agony, the endless groan,<br />
Which, through the ages that have gone before us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In long reverberations reach our own.</p>
<p class="poetry">On helm and harness rings the Saxon hammer,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Cimbric forest roars the Norseman&rsquo;s
song,<br />
And loud, amid the universal clamor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er distant deserts sounds the Tartar
gong.</p>
<p class="poetry">I hear the Florentine, who from his palace<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheels out his battle bell with dreadful din,<br />
And Aztec priests upon their teocallis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat the wild war drums made of serpent&rsquo;s
skin.</p>

<p class="poetry">The bursting shell, the gateway wrenched
asunder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rattling musketry, the clashing blade;<br />
And ever and anon, in tones of thunder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The diapason of the cannonade.</p>
<p class="poetry">Is it, O man, with such discordant noises,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; With such accursed instruments as these,<br />
Thou drownest nature&rsquo;s sweet and kindly voices,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And jarrest the celestial harmonies?</p>
<p class="poetry">Were half the power that fills the world with
terror,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and

Given to redeem the human mind from error,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no need of arsenals or forts.</p>
<p class="poetry">The warrior&rsquo;s name would be a name
abhorred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every nation, that should lift again<br />
Its hand against a brother, on its forehead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would wear for evermore the curse of Cain!</p>
<p class="poetry">Down the dark future, through long
generations,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The echoing sounds grow fainter, and then cease;<br

And, like a bell, with solemn, sweet vibrations,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear once more the voice of Christ say
&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Peace!&nbsp; And no longer from its brazen
portals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blast of war&rsquo;s great organ shakes the

But beautiful as songs of the immortals<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The holy melodies of love arise.</p>

<p>The death is announced of First Class Petty Officer Grounds of
H. M. S. Terrible, the best shot with a heavy gun in the British

for the unparalleled achievement of making eight shots in one
minute in 1901 with the six-inch gun, and seven hits out of eight
rounds in one minute under most unfavorable weather conditions in
1902, he received in all the magnificent remuneration of 1
shilling 9 pence, and 6 shillings 3 pence in the two years,
&ldquo;his proper share of prize money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>The statesman at the council</i>, <i>and the

And the run of his pay?&nbsp; Three shillin&rsquo;s a day, with
biscuit and salted meat.<br />
He was the man who could pitch his shell on a mark that was never
still<br />
Eight times true while a minute flew, and parliament whittled the
bill;<br />
He was a man who could soothe a gun in the race of a swirling
tide,<br />
Who could chime his shots with the charging knots of a ship with
a dripping side,<br />
Who could get to his mark from a dancing deck that never a moment
stood,<br />
Content to hear, for a Bisley cheer, a midshipman&rsquo;s
muttered &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>

THE DANDELION.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.</span></h2>
<p>This poem, like Bryant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Waterfowl,&rdquo; like
many of Longfellow&rsquo;s, speaks of the objects of nature in a
reflective, almost religious tone, portraying the love of our
American poets for &ldquo;these living pages of God&rsquo;s
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Dear common flower, that grow&rsquo;st beside
the way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold,<br />
First pledge of blithesome May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which children pluck, and, full of pride, uphold,<br
/>
High hearted buccaneers, o&rsquo;erjoyed that they<br />
An El Dorado in the grass have found,<br />
Which not the rich earth&rsquo;s ample round<br />
May match in wealth, thou art more dear to me<br />
Than all the prouder summer blooms may be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Gold such as thine ne&rsquo;er drew the Spanish
prow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the primeval hush of Indian seas,<br />
Nor wrinkled the lean brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of age to rob the lover&rsquo;s heart of ease;<br />
&rsquo;Tis the spring&rsquo;s largess, which she scatters now<br
/>
To rich and poor alike, with lavish hand,<br />
Though most hearts never understand<br />
To take it at God&rsquo;s value, but pass by<br />
The offered wealth with unrewarded eye,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>Thou art my tropics and mine Italy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To look at thee unlocks a warmer clime;<br />
The eyes thou givest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are in the heart, and heed not space or time.<br />
Not in mid-June the gold cuirassed bee<br />
Feels a more summerlike warm ravishment<br />
In the white lily&rsquo;s breezy tent,<br />
His fragrant Sybaris, than I, when first<br />
From the dark green thy yellow circles burst.</p>
<p class="poetry">How like a prodigal doth nature seem,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou, for all thy gold, so common art!<br />
Thou teachest me to deem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More sacredly of every human heart,<br />
Since each reflects in joy its scanty gleam<br />
Of heaven, and could some wondrous secret show,<br />
Did we but pay the love we owe.<br />
And with a child&rsquo;s undoubting wisdom look,<br />
On all these pages of God&rsquo;s book.</p>

BALLAD OF THE BOAT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY RICHARD GARNETT.</span></h2>
<p>This poem has passed in American books of selections as having
been written by an unknown &ldquo;R. Garrett,&rdquo; this being
mainly the consequence of an error in editing the little book
called &ldquo;Sea and Shore,&rdquo; some twenty years ago.&nbsp;
It now, however, appears as the work of a man dear to many
Americans, Dr. Richard Garnett, late of the British Museum.</p>
<p class="poetry">The stream was smooth as glass.&nbsp; We said:
&ldquo;Arise, and let&rsquo;s away.&rdquo;<br />
The Siren sang beside the boat that in the rushes lay,<br />
And spread the sail and strong the oar, we gayly took our way.<br
/>
When shall the sandy bar be crost?&nbsp; When shall we find the
bay?</p>
<p class="poetry">The broadening flood swells slowly out
o&rsquo;er cattle dotted plains;<br />
The stream is strong and turbulent, and dark with heavy rains;<br
/>
The laborer looks up to see our shallop speed away.<br />
When shall the sandy bar be crost?&nbsp; When shall we find the
bay?</p>
<p class="poetry">Now are the clouds like fiery shrouds; the sun,
superbly large,<br />
Slow as an oak to woodman&rsquo;s stroke, sinks flaming at their
marge;<br />
The waves are bright with mirror&rsquo;d light as jacinths on our
way.<br />
When shall the sandy bar be crost?&nbsp; When shall we find the
bay?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>The moon is high up in the sky, and now no more we
see<br />
The spreading river&rsquo;s either bank, and surging distantly<br
/>
There booms a sudden thunder as of breakers far away;<br />
Now shall the sandy bar be crost, now shall we find the bay!</p>
<p class="poetry">The seagull shrieks high overhead, and dimly to
our sight<br />
The moonlit crests of foaming waves gleam towering through the
night.<br />
We&rsquo;ll steal upon the mermaid soon, and start her from her
lay,<br />
When once the sandy bar is crost and we are in the bay.</p>
<p class="poetry">What rises white and awful as a shroud enfolded
ghost?<br />
What roar of rampant tumult bursts in clangor on the coast?<br />
Pull back! pull back!&nbsp; The raging flood sweeps every oar
away.<br />
O stream, is this thy bar of sand?&nbsp; O boat, is this the
bay?</p>

<p class="poetry">It was many and many a year ago,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a kingdom by the sea,<br />
That a maiden lived whom you may know<br />
By the name of Annabel Lee;<br />
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than to love and be loved by me.</p>
<p class="poetry">I was a child and she was a child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this kingdom by the sea;<br />
But we loved with a love that was more than love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I and my Annabel Lee;<br />
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Coveted her and me.</p>
<p class="poetry">And this was the reason that long ago,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this kingdom by the sea,<br />
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br />
So that her high born kinsman came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bore her away from me,<br />
To shut her up in a sepulcher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this kingdom by the sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">The angels, not so happy in heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went envying her and me;<br />
Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>

dreams<br />

And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes<br />

&ldquo;Bartholomew Fair,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Epicoene.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He died in 1637, after several years of illness, which affected
his wit and brilliancy in such a manner that many of his later
plays were not heard to the end.&nbsp; He is buried in
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; He also wrote some prose and some of the

<p class="poetry">In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stately pleasure dome decree,<br />
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran,<br />
Through caverns measureless to man,<br />

So twice five miles of fertile ground<br />
<a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>With
walls and towers were girdled round;<br />
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where blossomed many an incense bearing tree;<br />
And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br />
The shadow of the dome of pleasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Floated midway on the waves,<br />
Where was heard the mingled measure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the fountain and the caves.<br />
It was a miracle of rare device,<br />
A sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A damsel with a dulcimer<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; In a vision once I saw;<br />
It was an Abyssinian maid,<br />
And on her dulcimer she played,<br />
Singing of Mount Abora.<br />
Could I revive within me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her symphony and song<br />
To such deep delight &rsquo;twould win me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That with music loud and long<br />
I would build that dome in air&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<br />
And all who heard should see them there,<br />
And all should cry, Beware!&nbsp; Beware!<br />
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weave a circle round him thrice,<br />
And close your eyes with holy dread,<br />
For he on honey dew hath fed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drunk the milk of Paradise.</p>

BALLAD UPON A WEDDING.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY SIR JOHN SUCKLING.</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">Her finger was so small, the ring<br />
Would not stay on, which they did bring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was too wide a peck;<br />
And to say truth (for out it must),<br />
It looked like the great collar (just)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About our young colt&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her feet beneath her petticoat,<br />
Like little mice, stole in and out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if they fear&rsquo;d the light;<br />
But oh, she dances such a way!<br />
No sun upon an Easter day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is half so fine a sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her cheeks so rare a white was on,<br />
No daisy makes comparison,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Who sees them is undone),<br />
For streaks of red were mingled there,<br />
Such as are on a Catherine pear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (The side that&rsquo;s next the sun).</p>
<p class="poetry">Her lips were red, and one was thin,<br />
Compar&rsquo;d to that was next her chin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Some bee had stung it newly);<br />
But (Dick) her eyes so guard her face<br />
I durst no more upon them gaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than on the sun in July.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">BY JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">And what is so rare as a day in June?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, if ever, come perfect days;<br />
Then heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And over it softly her warm ear lays;<br />
Whether we look, or whether we listen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We hear life murmur, or see it glisten;<br />
Every clod feels a stir of might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An instinct within it that reaches and towers,<br />
And, groping blindly above it for light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers;<br />
The flush of life may well be seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrilling back over hills and valleys;<br />
The cowslip startles in meadows green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,<br />
<a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>And
there&rsquo;s never a leaf nor a blade too mean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be some happy creature&rsquo;s palace;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Atilt like a blossom among the leaves,<br />
And lets his illumined being o&rsquo;errun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the deluge of summer it receives;<br />
His mate feels the eggs beneath her wings,<br />
And the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings<br />
He sings to the wide world and she to her nest&mdash;<br />
In the nice ear of nature, which song is the best?</p>

BELLS OF SHANDON.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY FRANCIS MAHONY.</span></h2>
<p>Francis Sylvester Mahony, better known as Father Prout, was
born in Cork in 1804.&nbsp; Though he was a Jesuit priest, he was
more of a literatus than a man of God.&nbsp; He is the author of
the famous &ldquo;Reliques of Father Prout,&rdquo; which he wrote
for Frazer&rsquo;s Magazine.&nbsp; Later he was the Rome
correspondent for the Daily News and the Paris correspondent of
the Globe.&nbsp; He died in Paris in 1866.&nbsp; Among his poems
the following is the only one worth mention:</p>
<p class="poetry">With deep affection and recollection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I often think of those Shandon bells,<br />
Whose sounds so wild would in the days of childhood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fling round my cradle their magic spells.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On this I ponder, where&rsquo;er I wander,<br />
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thee;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thy bells of Shandon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sound so grand on<br />
The pleasant waters of the River Lee.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine;<br />
While at a glib rate brass tongues would vibrate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all their music spoke naught like thine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For memory dwelling on each proud swelling<br />
Of thy belfry knelling its bold notes free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Made the bells of Shandon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound far more grand on<br />
The pleasant waters of the River Lee.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have heard bells tolling &ldquo;old
Adrian&rsquo;s mole&rdquo; in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their thunder rolling from the Vatican,<br />
And cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gorgeous turrets of Notre Dame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thy sounds were sweeter than the dome of
Peter<br />
Flings o&rsquo;er the Tiber, pealing solemnly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O! the bells of Shandon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound far more grand on<br />

<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s a bell in Moscow, while on tower

But there&rsquo;s an anthem more dear to me;<br />

The way to dusty death.&nbsp; Out, out, brief candle!<br />
Life&rsquo;s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br />

Sort me, O tongue and lips for nature&rsquo;s sake, souvenirs of
earliest summer,<br />
Gather the welcome signs (as children with pebbles of stringing
shells),<br />
Put in April and May, the hylas croaking in the ponds, the
elastic air,<br />
Bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes,<br />
Bluebird and darting swallow, nor forget the high-hole flashing
his golden wings,<br />
The tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor,<br />
Shimmer of waters with fish in them, the cerulean above.<br />
All that is jocund and sparkling, the brooks running,<br />
The maple woods, the crisp February days and the sugar making,<br
/>
The robin where he hops, bright-eyed, brown-breasted,<br />
With musical clear call at sunrise and again at sunset.<br />
Or flitting among the trees of the apple orchard, building the
nest of his mate,<br />
The melted snow of March, the willow sending forth its
yellow-green sprouts,<br />
For springtime is here!&nbsp; The summer is here, and what is
this in it and from it?<br />
Thou, soul, unloosen&rsquo;d&mdash;the restlessness after I know
not what;<br />
Come, let us lag here no longer, let us be up and away!<br />
O, if one could fly like a bird!<br />
O, to escape, to sail forth as in a ship!<br />

with thee, O soul, o&rsquo;er all, in all, as a ship o&rsquo;er

morning drops of dew,<br />
The lilac-scent, the bushes with dark green heart-shaped
leaves,<br />
Wood violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called
innocent<br />
Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their
atmosphere<br />
To grace the bush I love&mdash;to sing with the birds,<br />
A warble for joy of lilac-time.</p>

<p class="poetry">The quality of mercy is not strain&rsquo;d,<br

It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br />
Upon the place beneath.&nbsp; It is twice blest:<br />
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.<br />
&rsquo;Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes<br />
The throned monarch better than his crown;<br />
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br />
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br />
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br />
But mercy is above this sceptered sway;<br />
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<br />
It is an attribute to God himself;<br />
And earthly power doth then show likest God&rsquo;s<br />
When mercy seasons justice.</p>

210</span>NOCTURNE.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH.</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">Up to her chamber window,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A slight wire trellis goes,<br />
And up this Romeo ladder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clambers a bold white rose.<br />
I lounge in the ilex shadows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see the lady lean,<br />
Unclasping her silken girdle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The curtain&rsquo;s folds between.</p>
<p class="poetry">She smiles on her white-rose lover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She reaches out her hand<br />
And helps him in at the window&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see it where I stand!<br />
To her scarlet lip she holds him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kisses him many a time&mdash;<br />
Ah me!&nbsp; It was he that won her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he dared to climb.</p>
<h2>THE SOCIETY UPON THE STANISLAUS.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY BRET HARTE.</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">I reside at Table Mountain and my name is
Truthful James;<br />
I am not up to small deceit or any sinful games;<br />
And I&rsquo;ll tell in simple language what I know about the
row<br />
That broke up our society upon the Stanislow.</p>
<p class="poetry">But first I would remark that it is not a
proper plan<br />
For any scientific gent to whale his fellow man,<br />
And if a member don&rsquo;t agree with his peculiar whim<br />
To lay for that same member for to &ldquo;put a head&rdquo; on
him.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now nothing could be finer or more beautiful to
see<br />
Than the first six months&rsquo; proceedings of that same
society,<br />
Till Brown of Calaveras brought a lot of fossil bones<br />
That he found within a tunnel near the tenement of Jones.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>Then Brown he read a paper, and he reconstructed
there,<br />
From those same bones an animal that was extremely rare;<br />
And Jones then asked the chair for a suspension of the rules<br
/>
Till he could prove that those same bones was one of his lost
mules.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile, and said
he was at fault,<br />
It seems he had been trespassing on Jones&rsquo; family vault;<br
/>
He was a most sarcastic man, this quiet Mr. Brown,<br />
And on several occasions he had cleaned out the town.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now I hold it is not decent for a scientific
gent<br />
To say another is an ass&mdash;at least, to all intent;<br />
Nor should the individual who happens to be meant<br />
Reply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Abner Dean of Angel&rsquo;s raised a point
of order, when&mdash;<br />
A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen,<br />
And he smiled a kind of sickly smile and curled up on the
floor,<br />
And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">For, in less time than I write it, every member
did engage<br />
In a warfare with the remnants of a paleozoic age;<br />
And the way they heaved those fossils in their anger was a
sin,<br />
Till the skull of an old mammoth caved the head of Thompson
in.</p>
<p class="poetry">And this is all I have to say of these improper
games,<br />
For I live at Table Mountain and my name is Truthful James;<br />
And I&rsquo;ve told in simple language what I know about the
row<br />
That broke up our society upon the Stanislow.</p>

<p>These verses were written by the author of &ldquo;The Blue and

Hale, was born at Coventry, Conn., June 6, 1755.&nbsp; He was
sent to New York by Washington to get information about the
British, and was arrested while on that mission.&nbsp; He was
hanged as a spy by order of Sir William Howe, Sept. 22,
1776.&nbsp; By his executioner he was denied the use of a Bible,

<p class="poetry">To drum beat and heart beat,<br />

There is color in his cheek,<br />

<p class="poetry">By the starlight and moonlight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He seeks the Briton&rsquo;s camp;<br />
He hears the rustling flag<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the armed sentry&rsquo;s tramp;<br />
And the starlight and the moonlight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His silent wanderings lamp.</p>
<p class="poetry">With slow tread and still tread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He scans the tented line;<br />
And he counts the battery guns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the gaunt and shadowy pine;<br />
And his slow tread and still tread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives no warning sign.</p>
<p class="poetry">The dark wave, the plumed wave,<br />

With a sharp clang, a steel clang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The patriot is bound.</p>
<p class="poetry">With a calm brow and a steady brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He listens to his doom;<br />
In his look there is no fear,<br />

But with calm brow and steady brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He robes him for the tomb.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the long night, the still night,<br />

And the brutal guards withhold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en the solemn word of God!<br />
In the long night, the still night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He walks where Christ hath trod.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Neath the blue morn, the sunny morn,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; He dies upon the tree;<br />
And he mourns that he can lose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But one life for liberty;<br />
And in the blue morn, the sunny morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His spent wings are free.</p>
<p class="poetry">But his last words, his message words,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They burn, lest friendly eye<br />
Should read how proud and calm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A patriot could die.<br />
With his last words, his dying words,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A soldier&rsquo;s battle cry.</p>
<p class="poetry">From fame leaf and angel leaf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From monument and urn,<br />
The sad earth, the glad of heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His tragic fate shall learn;<br />
And on fame leaf and angel leaf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of HALE shall burn!</p>

224</span>SOLILOQUY FROM &ldquo;HAMLET.&rdquo;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE.</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">To be, or not to be; that is the question;<br
/>
Whether &rsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br />
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br />
And by opposing end them?&nbsp; To die: to sleep:<br />
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br />
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br />
That flesh is heir to; &rsquo;tis a consummation<br />
Devoutly to be wished.&nbsp; To die; to sleep;<br />
To sleep: perchance to dream: aye, there&rsquo;s the rub;<br />
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br />
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br />
Must give us pause: there&rsquo;s the respect<br />
That makes calamity of so long life;<br />
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br />
The oppressor&rsquo;s wrong, the proud man&rsquo;s contumely,<br
/>
The pangs of despis&rsquo;d love, the law&rsquo;s delay,<br />
The insolence of office, and the spurns<br />
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />
When he himself might his quietus make<br />
With a bare bodkin?&nbsp; Who would fardels bear,<br />
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
But that the dread of something after death&mdash;<br />
The undiscover&rsquo;d country from whose bourn<br />
No traveler returns&mdash;puzzles the will<br />
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br />
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br />
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br />
And thus the native hue of resolution<br />
Is sicklied o&rsquo;er with the pale cast of thought,<br />
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br />
With this regard their currents turns awry<br />
And lose the name of action.</p>

226</span>ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY GENL. WILLIAM H. LYTLE.</span></h2>
<p>William Haines Lytle was born at Cincinnati, O., in 1826, and
died a hero&rsquo;s death at Chickamauga in 1863.&nbsp; He
enlisted in the Mexican war in 1846, and served with
distinction.&nbsp; Afterwards he attained prominence as a lawyer
and politician.&nbsp; When the civil war broke out he was
appointed major general of volunteers.&nbsp; At Carnifex ferry he
was desperately wounded, but recovered and took charge of a
brigade.&nbsp; He was again wounded at Perryville and
captured.&nbsp; Being exchanged, he was promoted to brigadier
general and fought in many engagements till Sept. 29, 1863.&nbsp;
His poems were never collected in book form.&nbsp; This one was
written in 1857.</p>
<p class="poetry">I am dying, Egypt, dying!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ebbs the crimson life-tide fast,<br />
And the dark Plutonian shadows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gather on the evening blast.<br />
Let thine arms, O queen, enfold me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hush thy sobs and bow thine ear.<br />
Listen to the great heart secrets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou, and thou alone, must hear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though my scarred and veteran legions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear their eagles high no more,<br />
And my wrecked and scattered galleys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strew dark Actium&rsquo;s fatal shore;<br />
Though no glittering guards surround me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prompt to do their master&rsquo;s will,<br />
I must perish like a Roman&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Die the great Triumvir still!</p>
<p class="poetry">Let no Cesar&rsquo;s servile minions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mock the lion thus laid low;<br />
&rsquo;Twas no foeman&rsquo;s arm that felled him;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas his own that struck the blow&mdash;<br
/>
His who, pillowed on thy bosom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned aside from glory&rsquo;s ray&mdash;<br />
His who, drunk with thy caresses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Madly threw a world away.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>Should the base plebeian rabble<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dare assail my name at Rome,<br />
Where my noble spouse, Octavia,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeps within her widowed home,<br />
Seek her; say the gods bear witness&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Altars, augurs, circling wings&mdash;<br />
That her blood with mine commingled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet shall mount the throne of kings.</p>
<p class="poetry">As for thee, star-eyed Egyptian!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glorious sorceress of the Nile!<br />
Light the path to Stygian horrors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the splendors of thy smile.<br />
Give to C&aelig;sar crowns and arches,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let his brow the laurel twine;<br />
I can scorn the senate&rsquo;s triumphs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Triumphing in love like thine.</p>
<p class="poetry">I am dying, Egypt, dying;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark! the insulting foeman&rsquo;s cry.<br />
They are coming&mdash;quick, my falchion!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me front them ere I die.<br />
Ah! no more amid the battle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall my heart exulting swell;<br />
Isis and Osiris guard thee!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleopatra&mdash;Rome&mdash;farewell!</p>
<h2><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>O,
WHY SHOULD THE SPIRIT OF MORTAL BE PROUD?<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY WILLIAM KNOX.</span></h2>
<p>The following poem was a particular favorite with Abraham
Lincoln.&nbsp; It was first shown to him when a young man by a
friend, and afterwards he cut it from a newspaper and learned it
by heart.&nbsp; He said to a friend: &ldquo;I would give a great
deal to know who wrote it, but have never been able to
ascertain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did afterwards learn the name of the
author.</p>
<p>William Knox was a Scottish poet who was born in 1789 at Firth
and died in 1825 at Edinburgh.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Lonely Hearth and
Other Poems&rdquo; was published in 1818, and &ldquo;The Songs of
Israel,&rdquo; from which &ldquo;O, Why Should the Spirit of
Mortal be Proud&rdquo; is taken, in 1824.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott
was an admirer of Knox&rsquo;s poems, and befriended the author
when his habits brought him into need.</p>
<p class="poetry">O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?<br
/>
Like a swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,<br />
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,<br />
Man passeth from life to his rest in the grave.</p>
<p class="poetry">The leaves of the oak and the willow shall
fade,<br />
Be scattered around, and together be laid;<br />
As the young and the old, the low and the high,<br />
Shall crumble to dust and together shall lie.</p>
<p class="poetry">The infant a mother attended and loved,<br />
The mother that infant&rsquo;s affection who proved,<br />
The father that mother and infant who blest&mdash;<br />
Each, all, are away to that dwelling of rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">The maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in
whose eye,<br />
Shone beauty and pleasure&mdash;her triumphs are by;<br />
And alike from the minds of the living erased<br />
Are the memories of mortals who loved her and praised.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>The head of the King, that the scepter hath borne;<br
/>
The brow of the priest, that the miter hath worn;<br />
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave&mdash;<br />
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.</p>
<p class="poetry">The peasant whose lot was to sow and to
reap;<br />
The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the steep;<br />
The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread&mdash;<br />
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.</p>
<p class="poetry">So the multitude goes, like the flower or the
weed,<br />
That withers away to let others succeed;<br />
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,<br />
To repeat every tale that has often been told.</p>
<p class="poetry">For we are the same our fathers have been;<br
/>
We see the same sights our fathers have seen;<br />
We drink the same stream, we see the same sun,<br />
And run the same course our fathers have run.</p>
<p class="poetry">The thoughts we are thinking our fathers did
think;<br />
From the death we are shrinking our fathers did shrink;<br />
To the life we are clinging our fathers did cling,<br />
But it speeds from us all like the bird on the wing.</p>
<p class="poetry">They loved&mdash;but the story we cannot
unfold;<br />
They scorned&mdash;but the heart of the haughty is cold;<br />
They grieved&mdash;but no wail from their slumbers will come;<br
/>
They joyed&mdash;but the tongue of their gladness is dumb.</p>
<p class="poetry">They died&mdash;ah! they died&mdash;we, things
that are now,<br />
That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,<br />
And make in their dwelling a transient abode,<br />
Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and
pain,<br />
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain,<br />
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,<br />
Still follow each other like surge upon surge.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&rsquo;Tis the wink of an eye; &rsquo;tis the draught
of a breath,<br />
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,<br />
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud;<br />
O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?</p>
<h2>THE THREE FISHERS.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY CHARLES KINGSLEY.</span></h2>
<p>Charles Kingsley was born in Devonshire in 1819; he died in
1875.&nbsp; His poetical works consist of &ldquo;The
Saint&rsquo;s Tragedy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Andromeda and Other
Poems.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Three fishers went sailing out into the
West,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out into the West as the sun went down;<br />
Each thought on the woman who loved him the best;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the children stood watching them out of the
town;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For men must work and women must
weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s little to earn,
and many to keep;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the
harbor bar be moaning.</p>
<p class="poetry">Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;<br
/>
They looked at the squall and they looked at the shower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rack it came rolling up ragged and brown!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But men must work and women must
weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though storms be sudden and waters
deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the harbor
bar be moaning.</p>
<p class="poetry">Three corpses lay out on the shining sands<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning gleam as the tide went down,<br />
And the women are weeping and wringing their hands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who will never come back to the town;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For men must work and women must
weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sooner it&rsquo;s over,
the sooner to sleep&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And good-by to
the bar and its moaning.</p>
<h2><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>PSALM XLVIII.</h2>
<p class="poetry">Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised<br
/>
In the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness,<br />
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth,<br />
Is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great
King.<br />
God is known in her palaces for a refuge,<br />
For, lo, the kings were assembled,<br />
They passed by together.<br />
They saw it and so they marveled;<br />
They were troubled, and hasted away.<br />
Fear took hold upon them there,<br />
And pain, as of a woman in travail.<br />
Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind,<br />
As we have heard, so have we seen<br />
In the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God;<br />
God will establish it forever.<br />
We have thought of thy loving-kindness, O God,<br />
In the midst of thy temple.<br />
According to thy name, O God,<br />
So is thy praise unto the ends of the earth;<br />
Thy right hand is full of righteousness.<br />
Let Mount Zion rejoice,<br />
Let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.<br
/>
Walk about Zion, and go round about her;<br />
Tell the towers thereof.<br />
Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces;<br />
That ye may tell it to the generation following.<br />
For this God is our God for ever and ever;<br />
He will be our guide even unto death.</p>
<h2><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>THE
ISLES OF GREECE.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY LORD BYRON.</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where burning Sappho loved and sung,<br />
Where grew the arts of war and peace&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Delos rose and Ph&oelig;bus sprung!<br />
Eternal summer gilds them yet,<br />
But all except their sun, is set.</p>
<p class="poetry">The mountains look on Marathon&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Marathon looks on the sea;<br />
And, musing there an hour alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I dream&rsquo;d that Greece might still be free;<br
/>
For standing on the Persians&rsquo; grave<br />
I could not deem myself a slave.</p>
<p class="poetry">A King sate on the rocky brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which looks o&rsquo;er sea-born Salamis;<br />
And ships, by thousands, lay below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And men in nations&mdash;all were his!<br />
He counted them at break of day&mdash;<br />
And when the sun set where were they?</p>
<p class="poetry">And where are they? and where art thou,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My country?&nbsp; On thy voiceless shore<br />
The heroic lay is tuneless now&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heroic bosom beats no more!<br />
And must thy lyre, so long divine,<br />
Degenerate into hands like mine?</p>
<p class="poetry">Must we but weep o&rsquo;er days more blest?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must we but blush?&nbsp; Our father&rsquo;s bled.<br
/>
Earth! render back from out thy breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A remnant of our Spartan dead!<br />
Of the three hundred grant but three,<br />
To make a new Thermopyl&aelig;!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>In vain&mdash;in vain: strike other chords;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill high the cup with Samian wine!<br />
Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shed the blood of Scio&rsquo;s vine!<br />
Hark! rising to the ignoble call&mdash;<br />
How answers each bold Bacchanal!</p>
<p class="poetry">You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?<br />
Of two such lessons, why forget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nobler and the manlier one?<br />
You have the letters Cadmus gave&mdash;<br />
Think ye he meant them for a slave?</p>
<p class="poetry">Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our virgins dance beneath the shade&mdash;<br />
I see their glorious black eyes shine!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But gazing on each glowing maid,<br />
My own the burning tear-drop laves,<br />
To think such breasts must suckle slaves.</p>
<p class="poetry">Place me on Sunium&rsquo;s marbled steep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where nothing, save the waves and I,<br />
May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There, swan-like, let me sing and die:<br />
A land of slaves shall ne&rsquo;er be mine&mdash;<br />
Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/5/3/4/1/53415


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
